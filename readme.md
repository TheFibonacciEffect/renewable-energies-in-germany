![Histogram](<plots/renewables proportion histogram.png>)

A histogram depicting the fraction of the power of renewable energies (Wind offshore, Wind onshore, Solar, Biomass, Hydro Run-of-River, Geothermal, Hydro water reservoir, Hydro pumped storage) (in MW) on the Eletronic load in Germany in 2023

![Wind Solar](<plots/ws storage proportion histogram.png>)

same histogram only includeing wind and solar

![ws storage](<plots/ws storage proportion histogram.png>)

histogram combining wind, solar and storage (the power of Hydro pumped storage consumption is actually negative as it should be)


![residual load](<plots/residual load proportion histogram.png>)

reiduallast ist die last, die durch nicht fluktuierende erzeuger gedeckt werden muss

![Proportion of renewables](<plots/renewables proportion.png>)

![coalgas](<plots/coal gas proportion histogram.png>)

The prices are also very interresting, we can see that the chance that you can get 1MWh of electricity for -5€ to 5€ is the same propabilty of getting it for 65 to 75 or 135 to 145 €
